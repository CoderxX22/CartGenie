# Problem Statement
Creating an organized grocery list is a daily struggle for many people. The process of checking product needs often involves standing in front of the fridge, manually taking notes, and trying to remember missing items. Many people rely on paper lists or simple notes on their phones, which can be easily lost or forgotten. As a result, they frequently overlook essential products, leading to incomplete shopping trips and wasted time.

Our goal is to simplify and streamline this process using AI-powered automation, making grocery shopping effortless, efficient, and stress-free.
