# Abstract
Purchasing groceries is an integral part of daily life, but the preparatory process involves a series of manual tasksâ€”alerting household members, checking existing supplies, and drawing up lists. 
Despite the assistance from digital tools like phone applications, chatbots, or memo papers, users often recall essential items at times and do not synchronize food consumption with their medical needs. 
We create a smart grocery management platform that moves beyond traditional mechanisms. The system can predict potential diseases by scanning blood test reports from users and generating individualized shopping lists according to health-based dietary advice. It also scans supermarket receipts to check if the items purchased are by the health-based diet advice of the user.
The platform reduces man-power usage, automates core processes, and optimizes the effectiveness of food shopping by involving health and nutrition advice in the purchase process.


# Project Category
This project falls under research and development (R&D) in the field of mobile application development and ML-driven automation.
It focuses on improving the grocery shopping experience by leveraging machine learning to analyze user Blood Test, physical parameters, and recipe preferences.
The app intelligently generates personalized feedback which gives the user information if the purchase is valid for their health state.
By continuously learning from user interactions, the system enhances efficiency, reduces manual effort, and optimizes grocery shopping.
